Hello.

You must have been briefed already about the matter if you're reading this, but
just to make sure you don't forget, I've left you this memo here.

Our company, E-Corp, has recently been the target of a cyberattack, which led to 50 million dollars
being substracted from various of our accounts. This is no petty theft, nor is it a
happy-go-lucky amateur. This was a coordinated hit from an unknown assailant.

We've contacted you because of your reputation. Impecable tracking and social engineering skills,
doesn't adhere to any cause nor believe in good or evil, only in cold, hard cash.
A true grey hat.


This terminal is a very special one. We've granted it access to most of our company's servers
and services (the ones that you need to know of, anyway). Use this access to investigate
and trace the source of the attack.

Once you've identified the ip address of the culprit, use the <color="#00FF00">send</color> command to send
it as an anonymous tip to the Police. We'll deny any connection with you or knowledge of your actions, so don't
try to play us.

It should go without saying, but if you need to check what we've suited this terminal with,
run <color="#00FF00">list-commands 1</color>, <color="#00FF00">list-commands 2</color>, or <color="#00FF00">list-commands 3</color>, and see for yourself.
