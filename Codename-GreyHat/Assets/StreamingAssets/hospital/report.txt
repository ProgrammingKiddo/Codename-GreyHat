Today a patient assaulted one of our doctors. In the struggle, she hit him on accident
and broke his nose. This cause quite the commotion.

The patient claims he was under heavy med influence, however the doctors
that were treating him, Dr. Blood and Dr. /*redacted*/ have assured me
time and time again that he wasn't under the influence of any meds at the time of the assault.

The patient is a big fish from a big business, so I'm really unsure how this is going to end.
I'm not sure how her daughter Helen might react, I've heard from Dr. /*redacted*/ that she
works for that same company, they love each other so much.

I've overheard the hospital director talking about a settlement tomorrow morning.
I fear the worst, the doctor getting laid off, and the hospital having to pay big time.
