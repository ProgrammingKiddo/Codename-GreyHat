[21-Apr-2021]: Something horrible must have happened at the hospital today.
		Mother won't talk about it, she seems disdraught, fragile, distant. It pains me to see her like that.
		I have to find out what has happened today.
[22-Apr-2021]: I can't f*cking believe it, after all my mother's done for that hospital
		and for the good people that work there, they just treat her like that? And for that b*stard?
		I feel so ashamed to even work for a company like this.
[23-Apr-2021]: Today I've found out one of the execs had deleted my employee entry from the database.
		There's no mixup, I'm getting fired asap.
		Ran home crying.
		Mother still won't talk.
		Pain.
[24-Apr-2021]: I've heard in the news that E-Corp has suffered a massive cyberattack. Serves them right.
		All in all, it's probably bad news for me, because they'll surely try to make up their losses
		by cutting on employees' settlements.
		And yet... it seems like a warm small ray of sunshine on my face.
[25-Apr-2021]: The sunshine has completely disappeared.
		Today someone passed an envelope under my door. It was filled with threats, accusing me of
		the cyberattack and the grand theft.
		Mind racing, heart beating, chest might explode.
		I know they won't denounce me directly, not after the settlement with the hospital the other day
		since it could go public as a result.
		Oh, the irony.
		However it begs another question, if they won't be the ones to denounce me... then who will?
[29-Apr-2021]: Someone's following in my footsteps. I don't know how but I still have access to the e-corp
		employees server. Someone's been fiddling around with it, I'm sure of it.
		Are they trying to set me up? All I've managed to scrap the first three sections of
		a phishing server: <color="#0000FF">125.23.14</color> and a bunc of bits from the last one: '111101'.
		This all seems real fishy, there's something wrong. Maybe there's something more to it?
